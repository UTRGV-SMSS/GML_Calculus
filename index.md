# The GML Calculus I Project at UTRGV

Welcome! This site documents our ongoing project to implement and study **Specifications Grading** in *Calculus I* at our Hispanic-Serving Institution.

**What is Specs Grading?** Student work is evaluated against clear, binary criteria (*Satisfactory / Needs Revision*) aligned to transparent **Learning Targets**. Final grades are earned by completing target bundles rather than accumulating partial credit. The approach emphasizes mastery, equity, revision opportunities, and student agency.

**Why this project?** We aim to increase transparency and mastery, reduce ambiguity around grading, and support students’ mathematical identity and persistence, and growith mindset. Our implementation integrates: (1) clearly labeled learning targets, (2) specs-aligned exams and readiness checks, (3) structured revision opportunities (e.g., proctored retesting “Carnival Days”), and (4) ongoing evaluation of student outcomes and perceptions.

**Timeline.** Piloted in 2021–2022; scaled and refined in 2024–2025; ongoing dissemination in 2025–present (talks, papers, workshops, and public materials).
